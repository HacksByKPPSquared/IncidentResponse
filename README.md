# 💻 Lab 09 - Exploiting Java to Attack a Remote System 🔥

In this lab, we go full-on hacker mode (don’t worry, it's all in the name of learning!) as we use the **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)** to exploit Java vulnerabilities and gain access to remote systems. Buckle up—it’s about to get technical, but also a lot of fun! 😎

## 🌐 What We Did:

### 1.1 Using the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)

1. **Launch the Kali VM**: 
   Logged in as root (because we like to live dangerously), fired up the terminal, and ensured our networking was in place with `ifconfig`. If the loopback wasn’t playing nice, we fixed it. 🔄
   
2. **Start the Essentials**: 
   Kicked off both **apache2** and **postgresql** services. After all, no attack toolkit is complete without some backend magic! 🛠️

3. **Set the Stage with SET**: 
   Opened up the **Social Engineering Toolkit** using `setoolkit` and dove into some **website attack vectors**. We’re basically ninjas in the command line at this point. 🥷

4. **Go Big with Java Exploits**: 
   Selected **Java 7 Applet Remote Code Execution** (classic) from the browser exploit list, armed with **Windows Shell Reverse_TCP** as our payload. It’s like ordering off the secret hacker menu. 🍔

5. **Launched a Malicious URL**: 
   With our attack server running, we turned our attention to an innocent **Ubuntu VM**. Using Firefox, we navigated to a shady URL (hosted by us, of course), and… *click*—our Java exploit did the rest. 🎯

### 1.3 Using the Meterpreter Session

1. **Access the Meterpreter Session**: 
   The moment we’ve all been waiting for: our malicious payload opened a **meterpreter session**! Now, the victim’s system is ours to command. 🕹️

2. **Gather System Info**: 
   Used `sysinfo`, `getuid`, and `ps` to get the lowdown on the target’s operating system and processes. It’s like being Sherlock Holmes, but with more code. 🔍

3. **Screenshot and Download Files**: 
   Took a **screenshot** of the victim’s desktop (who says hacking can’t be visual?) and snagged their **passwd file**. 🎥🔓

4. **Shell Access**: 
   Entered the **shell** command to gain deeper access and verified it with `pwd`. At this point, we’re basically running the show. 💻👑

### 2. Collecting Volatile Data

1. **Collect Critical Data**: 
   Before shutting down our compromised system, we grabbed key volatile data from **RAM**, including system info, hostname, and the all-important timestamp. 📅🕒

2. **Logged Everything to report.txt**: 
   Created a **report.txt** file to log all the juicy details. After all, a good hacker is a tidy hacker! 📝

## 🔧 Tools of the Trade:

- **Kali Linux**: Because no pentesting session is complete without it. 🐉
- **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)**: A social engineer's best friend for launching attacks. 🎣
- **Meterpreter**: The all-seeing eye that gives you control of the target system. 👁️
- **Ubuntu VM**: The innocent victim in our little scenario. 😇

## 🔑 Why This Matters:

Understanding how exploits work (in this case, Java exploits) is crucial for defending against them. This lab shows how attackers gain remote access, move through systems, and collect data—all with the goal of helping you learn how to stop them in their tracks. 🚫👾

💡 **Pro-Tip**: Always keep your Java updated… or better yet, disable it! Trust me, it’s not worth
